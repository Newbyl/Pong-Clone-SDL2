# Pong-Nab-SDL2

This is my first project using SDL2, I created this pong clone to learn how to use SDL2 library.

# Requirement

You need to install SDL2 and SDL2_ttf libraries.

## Linux :
- sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
- sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev

## MacOS :
- brew install sdl2
- brew install sdl2_ttf

## Windows :
- Follow the instruction on https://www.libsdl.org/index.php

# Compilation

To compile the project you need to have "make" and "g++" or "clang++" compiler installed. 
After you just need to open a terminal in the folder and type "make all".
To launch the game just type in the terminal "./pong".

### Enjoy !
